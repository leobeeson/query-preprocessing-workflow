1,Did I receive any cashbacks or refunds from groceries or Amazon in 2023 and 2024?,processable,"refunds/cashbacks (via positive amount values), groceries merchants (via display_narrative ILIKE for grocery merchant names or category_id for grocery categories), Amazon merchant (via display_narrative ILIKE), date range (via transaction_booking_timestamp)","","Can identify refunds/cashbacks as transactions with positive amount values (income) where display_narrative matches grocery merchants (Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, etc.) or Amazon (ILIKE '%Amazon%' OR '%AMZN%'). Filter by 2023-2024 date range via transaction_booking_timestamp. Refunds from merchants appear as positive amounts with the same merchant name in display_narrative. Cannot distinguish between cashback vs refund semantically, but both are captured as positive-amount transactions from the specified merchants."
2,What was the day in 2024 when my combined spending on groceries and Amazon was the highest?,processable,"date (transaction_booking_timestamp), groceries category (via category_id for Expense > Groceries), Amazon merchant (display_narrative ILIKE), amount aggregation","","Can filter by year 2024, identify groceries transactions via category_id (Groceries categories), match Amazon via display_narrative ILIKE '%Amazon%' or '%AMZN%', group by date, sum amounts, and order by total descending. Note: ILIKE on display_narrative may miss some Amazon variations (e.g., 'AMZ*ROCKY RIDERS') but should capture most common patterns."
3,Which restaurants did I spend $150 on dining out last month?,processable,"restaurants (via Expense > Eating out > Restaurants category or display_narrative), amount ($150), date filter (last month via transaction_booking_timestamp)","","Can filter by Eating out category (category_id for 'Expense > Eating out'), filter by last month date range, then either find single transactions = $150 or group by display_narrative and filter HAVING SUM(amount) = $150.

ILIKE pattern should capture most Amazon transactions but may miss some variations like 'AMZ*ROCKY RIDERS'."

POS (Point of Sale) could be used for both in-store and online card payments. Some merchants in display_narrative include 'ONLINE' or '.com' suffixes (e.g., 'ASDA GROCERIES ONLINE', 'Boots.com'), but this is inconsistent and would require unreliable ILIKE pattern matching. Cannot definitively distinguish online vs in-store purchases for most transactions."

Join transactions → account_id → customer_id → budgets on category_id. For each month in last year: (1) check if budget was active (last_modified_timestamp and deleted flag), (2) SUM grocery spending for that month, (3) compare to budget.amount threshold. COUNT how many months where monthly_spending > budget.amount. Budgets are fixed thresholds applied monthly, so 'how many times' = count of months exceeding threshold."
17,Which hotel did I stay at in December 2024?,indeterminate,"date filter (December 2024 via transaction_booking_timestamp), hotel-related transactions","reliable hotel identification from merchant names","Can filter by December 2024 and search display_narrative ILIKE '%hotel%' or potentially filter by Vacation category (3bf50d42-0ced-88b7-ce99-46e07a75284b).
